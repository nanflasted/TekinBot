Another day _A_ and _B_ agreed to go again to the mountains
to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found
should be shared equally between them. Now _B_ found a very large
nut; but she said nothing about it to _A_, and kept it all to
herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it
stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to
_A_, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I
shall be choked.’ _A_ ran as fast as he could to the river, and
said, ‘River, give me some water, for _B_ lies in the mountain, and
will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,
and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ _A_ ran to
the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then
the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to _B_, who
lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride
said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow
in the garden.’ Then _A_ ran to the garden, and took the garland
from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then
the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to
the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to
_B_; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay
quite dead, and never moved any more.

Then _A_ was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts
came and wept with him over poor _B_. And six mice built a little
hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed
themselves before it, and _A_ drove them. On the way they
met the fox. ‘Where are you going, _A_?’ said he. ‘To bury my
_B_,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but
you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then
the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and
all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.

So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get
over?’ said _A_. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,
and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the
straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in
and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came
and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you
shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed
so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the
stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly
offered to help poor _A_ by laying himself across the stream;
and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and
managed to get _B_ out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,
who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water
and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.

Thus _A_ was left alone with his dead _B_; and having dug
a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.
Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he
died too; and so all were dead.
