THE _A_, THE _B_, AND THE _C_

Once upon a time, a _A_, a _B_, and a _C_, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The _B_â€™s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the _A_ fetched the water, and the _C_ saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the _B_, while out one day, met a
fellow _B_, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other _B_ sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the _A_ had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The _C_ had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the _B_ came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the _B_ next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the _A_ and the _C_ might, it was of no use; the _B_ remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the _C_ to bring in the wood, to the _A_
to cook, and to the _B_ to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The _C_ started in search of wood, the _B_
made the fire, and the _A_ put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the _C_ returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
_C_ remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the _B_
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the _C_, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The _B_ complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the _C_, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the _A_ all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the _B_ set the table, and the _A_ looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the _C_, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the _B_ came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The _B_ hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.
